simple, opt-in user identification for conda clients

This package is intended to be used by organizations who wish
to better count and/or identify the users of conda that they
have in their organization. This is accomplished by adding a
user identifable token into the user agent string that conda
offers repository servers. Administrators can then parse their
server logs to extract those identifers and act accordingly.
